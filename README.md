# vaccination-clinic-simulation-simul8
Discrete-event simulation of a COVID-19 vaccination clinic built in Simul8. The project models patient flow, queue dynamics, and staffing scenarios to identify bottlenecks, reduce waiting times, and optimise operational costs. Includes comparative analysis of two models to support data-driven healthcare decision-making.
